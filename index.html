<p id="one"><img src="assets/images/brady.png" alt="Tom Brady" height="140">My name is Tom Brady and I am
a NFL quarter back for the New England Patroits- I love to play for this organization. I love playing for the 
best team in the NFL, and with Danny Amendola and Rob Gronkowski I wish I've could've played with them threw my whole football experience
when I was back in school. </p>
<p id="two">I was born on August 3, 1977, in San Mateo, California, and was drafted by the NFL's New England Patriots in 2000, like I said earlier. I've won two 
NFL MVP awards, four Super Bowl MVP awards and a record five Super Bowls wins. My children are my biggest fans. I only wish I could be with them more.
People tell me I'm old but I still can play and was one of the youngest quater backs to enter a NFL Draft.
</p>
<p id="three"> We have two dogs.  They are quite a character and very affectionate. But for all the people asking for my retirement, I'm still gonna
be around for awhile. I have a wife that aspires to be a lot of things, and she travels a lot. My oldest son lives here in New York, three kids, 
and you're just always trying to juggle and you want to be there for them, and you want to be there for the hockey games and the soccer games. But you also realize 
the level of commitment it takes to give as much as you can to the team that needs you. As of now though, I see myself playing for a while.
